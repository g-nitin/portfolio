## Segify: Semantic Segmentation for Localized Artistic Effects
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/g-nitin/stylized-segmentation)

- Developed a novel approach for segment-based neural style transfer, combining AdaIN layers for real-time style transfer with the Segment Anything model for accurate segmentation
- Implemented an interactive user interface, enabling user-guided selection of content, style, target regions, and style loss weights for creative exploration
- The project offered a user-centric solution for artistic image manipulation, surpassing the limitations of traditional methods by providing localized style control


## Deep Learning & Autoencoders for Colorization
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/g-nitin/convolutional-autoencoder)
- Developed and trained a convolutional autoencoder for accurate image colorization of black and white photographs using Python and PyTorch
- Trained the model on nearly 28,000 images real-world images from the Google Landmarks dataset
